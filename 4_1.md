refactoring,
while the yarn tests are all green
we are sure that we didn't break anything


package.json

`  "dev": "NODE_PATH=./lib pm2 start lib/server.js --watch --interpreter babel-node", `

  this makes our base path ./lib, eliminating need for dir traversal, etc



webpack 
```
  resolve: {
    modules: [
      path.resolve('./lib'),
      path.resolve('./node_modules'),
    ]
  },
```


never refactor on a Red state (tests failing)

refactor on a Green state
so when you are done, it has to be green
