When data is invalid, passed down to state then props
React doesn't warn us, and we might not find out

minimum - propTypes

other options

Flow

===

ArticleList doesn't need the store

App -> ArticleList -> Article


===

Context API 

- <StoreContext>

however, it broke our Jest tests
since we are doing tree rendering in our snapshot

instead,use "Shallow rendering" from Enzyme
- only render the ArticleList component
for each, there will be a stub for <Article />

instead of using react-test-renderer,
Enzyme is perfect for shallow rendering
- has kind of similar to jQuery 

* debug Jest test in VSCode
use Jest All config
