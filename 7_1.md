App render method inits state
as full state from the store

but it does not need full store state

more properties on the state changes
causes wasteful re-renders

options

1. customize shouldComponentUpdate

```
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    return (
      nextState.articles !== this.state.articles
      || nextState.searchTerm !== this.state.searchTerm
    )
  }
```

not the best since there is a dependenct
between shouldComponentUpdate and render


2. subscribe only to a portion of state

```
  appState = () => {
    const { articles, searchTerm } = this.props.store.getState();
    return { articles, searchTerm };
  }
```

timestamp doesnt cause a wastefeul render,
but still works, since it's outside of
the appState

RULE!
alwasy make a connected component subscribe
to part of a state, not all of it
otherwise, it causes a wasteful rerender
