$ git show --decorate  # shows what changed from last commit

$ yarn dev

# create components/index.js

$ yarn add react react-dom webpack

# create webpack.config.js
# get stuff from https://webpack.js.org/concepts/

# edit entry, output, rules, add babel-loader

$ yarn add babel-loader

"webpack": "webpack -wd"    # watch, dev mode (source maps)

$ yarn add webpack-cli  # since webpack keeps asking on build

# react dev tools

# measure performance of webpack
$ time yarn webpack  # first remove the w flag in webpack -wd

-> 8 seconds
so slow, why?

>> dont run babel on node_modules  

{ test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: 'babel-loader' }
-> 2 seconds!

# put back w in watch -wd

* split screen so server on top: $ yarn dev
* and webpack on bottom: $ yarn webpack


# test babel stage-2 features
