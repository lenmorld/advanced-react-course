making an official API from the DataApi
for e.g. npm publishing

e.g. 

 cd lib/
mkdir state-api
cd state-api/
yarn init
...
question entry point (index.js): lib/index.js
...

 # npm publish  // when ready to publish

 why?

 if we publish this
 when on dev mode, we want to use new published  package
 not from local folder


put DataApi as state-api/index.js

App.jsx, DataApi.js
`import DataApi from 'state-api';`

this will work in prod.
no need for npm linking
grow both projects in dev

when ready publish to npm
push host proj to deploy without 'state-api'

before publish, transpile with Babel, since we are using ES6 modules there


 # npm publish  // when ready to publish
